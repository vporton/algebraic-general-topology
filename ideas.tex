This document contains a list of short ideas of future research in Algebraic
General Topology.

This research plan is not formal and may contain vague statements.

\section{Category theory}

Misc properties of continuous functions between endofuncoids and endoreloids.

$(A;B)\mapsto\mathsf{pFCD}(A;B)$ for posets $A$, $B$ is a tensor product
(in category theory sense). It is specifically likely that it is a tensor
product in the category of join-semilattices or a similar category.
See \url{http://mathoverflow.net/a/191444/4086} for a proof. It follows
$\mathsf{pFCD}(\mathsf{FCD}(\Src\circ f); \mathsf{FCD}(\Dst\circ f))$ in the book,
chapter ``Staroids and Multifuncoids'' can be reduced to a single tensor product.

\section{Compact funcoids}

Generalize the theorem that compact topology corresponds to only one uniformity.

For compact funcoids the Cantor's theorem that a function continuous on a compact is uniformly continuous.

Every closed subset of a compact space is compact. A compact subset of a Hausdorff space is closed. 17.5 theorem in Willard.

17.6 theorem in Willard.

17.7 theorem in Willard: The continuous image of a compact space is compact.

17.10 Theorem in Willard: A compact Hausdorff space $X$ is a $T_4$-space. Also 17.11 Corollary, 17.13, 17.14 theorem.

"Locally compact" for funcoids. See also 18 "Locally compact spaces: in Willard.

Compactification.

\section{Misc}

Say explicitly that pseudodifference is a special case of difference.

Develop Todd Trimble's idea to represent funcoids as a relation~$\xi$ further:
Define funcoid as a function from sets to sets of sets
$\xi(A\sqcup B) = \xi A\cap\xi B$ and $\xi\bot=\emptyset$.

Denote the set of least elements as $\operatorname{Least}$. (It is either an
one-element set or empty set.)

Show that cross-composition product is a special case of infimum product.

Analog of order topology for funcoids/reloids.

If a morphism converges to a value on two sets, it converges to the value also on their union.

A set is connected if every function from it to a discrete space is constant. Can this be generalized for generalized connectedness and generalized continuity? I have no idea how to relate these two concepts in general.

Develop theory of \emph{funcoidal groups} by analogy with topological groups.
Attempt to use this theory to solve this open problem:\\
\url{http://garden.irmacs.sfu.ca/?q=op/is_every_regular_paratopological_group_tychonoff}
Is it useful as topological group determines not only a topology but even a uniformity?

A space $\mu$ is $T_2$- iff the diagonal $\Delta$ is closed in $\mu\times\mu$.

The $\beta$-th projection map is not only continuous but also open (Willard, theorem 8.6).

$T_x$-separation axioms for products of spaces.

Willard 13.13 and its important corollary 13.14.

Willard 15.10.

About real-valued functions on endofuncoids: Urysohn's Lemma (and consequences: Tietze's extension theorem) for funcoids.

About product of reloids:\\
\url{http://portonmath.wordpress.com/2012/05/23/unfirunded-questions/}

Generalized Fr\'echet filter on a poset $\mathfrak{A}$ is a filter $\Omega$ such that
\[ \corestar\Omega = \setcond{x\in\mathfrak{A}}{\atoms x\text{ is infinite}}. \]
Research their properties (first, whether they exists for every poset).

Manifolds.

(free download, also Google for "pre-adjunction", also "semi" instead of "pre") Are $\tofcd$ and $\torldin$ adjunct?

Check how \href{http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/multicategory}{multicategories}
are related with categories with star-morphisms.
