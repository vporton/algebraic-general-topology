\chapter{Applications of algebraic general topology}

\fxnote{Should also Consider ``one-side topologies'' like $T\sqcap\setcond{(x;y)}{x,y\in\mathbb{R},y\ge x}$ where
$T$ is the usual topology on~$\mathbb{R}$. Wrap a $\pi$-length segment of this line into a circle
and get one-side circle: We can traverse continuously counter-clockwise but not clockwise.}

\section{``Hybrid'' objects}

Algebraic general topology allows to construct ``hybrid'' objects of ``continuous'' (as topological spaces)
and discrete (as graphs).

Consider for example $D\sqcup T$ where $D$ is a digraph and $T$ is a topological space.
I am unsure whether there are important applications of such hybrid objects.

\section{A way to construct directed topological spaces}

\fxnote{Should include definition of directed topological space.}

Directed topological spaces are defined at\\
\url{http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/directed+topological+space}

I propose a new way to construct a directed topological space. My way is more geometric/topological as it does not involve dealing with particular paths.

\begin{conjecture}
Every directed topological space can be constructed in the below described way.
\end{conjecture}

Consider topological space $T$ and its subfuncoid $F$ (that is $F$ is a funcoid which is less that $T$ in the order of funcoids).
Note that in our consideration $F$ is an endofuncoid (its source and destination are the same).

Then a directed path from point $A$ to point $B$ is defined as a continuous function $f$ from $[0;1]$ to $F$ such that $f(0)=A$ and $f(1)=B$.
\fxwarning{Specify whether the interval $[0;1]$ is treated as a proximity, pretopology, or preclosure.}

Because $F$ is less that $T$, we have that every directed path is a path.

\begin{conjecture}
The two directed topological spaces, constructed from a fixed topological space and two different funcoids,
are different.
\end{conjecture}

For a counter-example of (which of the two?) the conjecture consider funcoid $T\sqcap(\mathbb{Q}\times^{\mathsf{FCD}}\mathbb{Q})$
where $T$ is the usual topology on real line.

We need to consider stability of existence and uniqueness of a path under transformations of our funcoid and
under transformations of the vector field. Can this be a step to solve Navier-Stokes existence and smoothness problems?

It seems (check!) that solutions not only of differential equations but also of difference equations can be
expressed as paths in funcoids.
