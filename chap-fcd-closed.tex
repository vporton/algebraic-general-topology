\fxnote{What about the infinite products?}

\begin{thm}
The set of staroids
$\subsets X_1\times\dots\times\subsets X_n\to 2$ is
order isomorphic to co-frame of closed subsets of topological
product $\beta X_1\times\dots\times\beta X_n$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
$\subsets X_1\times\dots\times\subsets X_n\to 2$ is isomorphic to
the frame of ideals
$\mathfrak{J}(\subsets X_1\times\dots\times\subsets X_n)$ what is
dual (check!) to the frame of ideals of the distributive lattice
$\subsets X_1\otimes\dots\otimes\subsets X_n$.
This by ?? is the coproduct $\sum_i \subsets X_i$ in the category
of boolean algebras.
By Stone duality it is isomorphic to the topology of it spectrum
$\beta X_1\times\dots\times\beta X_n$.
\end{proof}
